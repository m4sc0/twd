# Contributing to TWD

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to TWD!  
I am really happy you are here and want to help make this project better.

TWD started as a simple tool to temporarily save and revisit directories without having to memorize long paths. Over time it became more of a quick menu or bookmark tool to jump between frequently used directories. If you also find it useful and want to improve it together, you are very welcome to contribute.

## Short Links to Important Resources

- Docs: See the [README.md](README.md)
- Bugs: Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/m4sc0/twd/issues) to report bugs and track progress
- Communication: For bug-related discussions, please use GitHub Issues. For general questions, you can reach me on Discord (there's no server yet): `masco`

## Testing

There are tests included in the repository.  
At the moment, the test setup may require some adjustments since it has not been updated in a while. Contributions to improving the tests are very welcome.

Location of tests: `tests/` directory.

## Environment Setup

How to set up your development environment is described in the [README.md](README.md).  
Please follow those instructions to get started.

## How to Submit Changes

1. Open an issue first to ask whether someone is already working on the bug or feature you want to contribute.
2. If the issue is not being worked on, feel free to start working on it and open a Pull Request.
3. Pull Requests should target the `develop` branch.
4. There is no PR template yet. Just describe your changes clearly.
5. Please do not squash your commits unless specifically asked.
6. The changes will be discussed in the PR and merged once approved. Mentioning in the next changelog is planned for all accepted contributions.

## How to Report a Bug

Please open a new Issue in the GitHub Issues tab with the following information:

- Clear description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce it
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or additional context

Bug report templates will be added later to make this process easier.

## How to Request an Enhancement

If you have an idea for an improvement or new feature, please open an Issue and label it as `enhancement`.  
Describe what the feature would do and why you think it is valuable for the project.

## Style Guide / Coding Conventions

Please follow standard Python coding conventions:

- PEP8 style guide
- Meaningful commit messages
- Keep code readable and clear
- Clear and concise commenting

If any style-related tools (like `black` or `isort`) are added in the future, they will be documented in the README.

## Code of Conduct

Be cool.  
Contributions must remain professional and strictly SFW. No extreme office speak required, slang is totally fine as long as everyone stays respectful.  
Any harassment or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
